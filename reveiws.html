              The website that I liked was kuiu hunting gear. They have a very easy layout on their page that provides a navigation bar on the top that easily gets you to what you're looking for. The comparison guides on each product type page are super convenient. This puts the products for example hunting pants side by side to show what they have and don't. If I were to make a website I would definitely incorporate comparison guides. As far as the coding goes, it was kind of confusing. I think they used plenty of HTML5 elements but the format and organization were very hard for me to understand. This being said I think the coding was pretty advanced to where someone like me couldn't read it.
              I did recognize codes like script  href style title body. Compared to other websites coding it was just kind of condensed and jumbled. The formation of brackets and parenthesis had me confused I had never seen coding like that before. That being said they put together a very nice website that is easy to navigate and I believe provides the best experience.

   Another website that I like and use a fair amount is Hoyt Archery. They have a lot of products and like Kuiu, have a bar at the top of the page that navigates to what you are looking for. The home page has large segments of new releases and interesting videos about bows and hunting. They have a bow builder segment with a 3D look at bows you can customize. 
   As for the coding it had some really simple sections and some sections that looked like foreign languages. There was a path polygon class that I had never seen before, followed by a paragraph of numbers. Below that there are numerous href links to different products that are spread out. Overall I think that the website is about as professional as it can get. The only conception would be the size of the product labels in the navigation bar, for someone like my dad, he can't read it.

       The website that I didn't like very much, is KUDU Point Broadheads. Their website has a nice image on the top of the page with a nice search bar, but below that and within that bar, the links are just kind of jumbled together. It kind of reminds me of Wikipedia. The padding and margins are visibly inconsistent in some parts of the website and just kind of look unprofessional. In their defense, people shopping on the website do not care about how it is made they just care about the product. That being said they might be able to improve sales with a better website.
       The coding of this website is probably the easiest for me to read. I think the reason for that is because I am a very entry-level website developer. I recognized the lines and lines of href and javascript links. The entire coding page was kind of compressed together and not very organized though.
