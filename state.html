    <h1> State Website </h1>
   
    <h2> <a href=" https://alaska.gov/"target="_blank"> Favorite State </a></h2>
    <h4> Alaska </h4>
    <p>  Alaska is my favorite state in general by far other than montana. Ive always wanted to live there and hunt the worlds most pretigous game. As far as the website goes, its very basic and easy to read. That is definitly my type of website. I am not into very flashy extra hard to navigate websites. </p>
    
    <h3>  <a href="https://portal.arkansas.gov/"target="_blank"> Blue State </a></h3>
      <h4>Arkansas </h4>
    <p> The Arkansas website was very well put together, everything was large and blown up so it was easy to see and navigate through. The search bar was large and all the icons were blown up. Arkansas is not my favorite state but the website was very pleasant. </p>
      
    <h2> <a href="https://www.maine.gov/portal/index.html"target="_blank"> That state </a></h2>
     
        <h4> Maine </h4>
    <p> Maines website was solid, nothing special. I thought it looked kind of like an older website as far as the grphics compared to Arkansas. the color way was kind of bland but overall the website was easy to navigate and thats what matters most. The pictures were well spread out and symetrical. the links were responsive and efficient. </p>

   <h4>  <a href="https://portal.kansas.gov/"target="_blank"> Least Favorite State </a></h4>
      <h4>Kansas </h4>
    <p> Kansas's website was put together very professionally and the diagrams and links were very nice. It loaded very efficiently and was user friendly. The one thing I thought was poor was the imagery. I think there needs to be a background or lots of large images of the state and there wasnt on here.</p>
   
    <h3>  <a href="https://www.maryland.gov/Pages/default.aspx"target="_blank"> Red State </a></h3>
      <h4>Maryland </h4>
    <p> This website was odd to say the least, the page is very small and has a red tint over the imagery. When I clicked on one of the two links it took me to another tab on my computer witch looked like a whole new website. Maryland might be one of the last places Id want to live so that is why it lands itself low on the list </p>
